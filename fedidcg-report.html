      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>As noted in our charter, the purpose of the Federated Identity
        Community Group is to provide a forum focused on incubating web features
        that will both support federated identity and prevent opaque,
        uncontrollable tracking of users across the web. The community group
        recognizes the need to balance privacy concerns against the need to
        explore innovative ideas around federated authentication on the web.
        The initial work of the group focuses on the short-term goals as
        prioritized by the urgency of changes already underway, such as the
        phasing out of third-party cookies. </p>
      <p>At the time of this report, the community group has several outputs,
        including a detailed list of federated authentication protocol elements
        and how they will be impacted by changes in third-party cookies, link
        decoration, and bounce tracking. The community group has also begun to
        document how different proposals and protocol elements might be used to
        mitigate the changes being introduced as browsers add mechanisms to
        prevent tracking. The group has one formal work item, the Federated
        Credential Management API, that explores one potential path for some
        services to follow as third-party cookies are deprecated. </p>
      <p>Given the complexity of the use cases surrounding federated
        authentication workflows, it is unlikely that any one proposal or work
        item in any standards organization will resolve all the issues that
        will arise as the low-level primitives on the web change or are removed.
        Part of the work of the community group is to gather sufficient
        information that developers will be able to determine what mix of
        protocol elements, browser APIs, and other tools will meet their needs
        in continuing to use federated identity on the web.</p>
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p><i>a glossary of terms that have specific domain definitions and clarify
      possible collisions as they relate to this context.</i></p>
    <p>Credentials - When browser vendors refer to credentials, they typically
      mean an object which allows a developer to make an authentication decision
      for a particular action. (See also <a href>https://www.w3.org/TR/credential-management-1/#core</a>)</p>
    <p>Sign-in - the act of authenticating into an existing account. While the
      user may experience this as part of the overall UX for a registration
      process, it is a logically distinct activity from Sign-up.</p>
    <p>Sign-out - the act of ending one or more sessions.</p>
    <p>Sign-up - the act of establishing or registering an account with a
      service. While an end-user can sign-up and sign-in simultaneously,
      logically they are two separate actions. (Similar to how some sites make
      the choice of “if you can authenticate, you are authorized to use/access
      the service” despite authentication and authorization being two logically
      distinct actions.)</p>
    <h2>Understanding Basic Federated Identity Flows</h2>
    <p>In any federated identity flow, there are effectively four parties
      involved: the user, the user-agent (the browser or app) the user is
      employing, the Relying Party that manages the resource the user is trying to
      access, and the Identity Provider that is validating the user’s access.</p>

    <img alt="four body diagram with user, user-agent, relying party, and identity provider" src="images/fedidcg-image4.png">

    <p>Generally speaking, the frameworks and protocols involved in identity
      federation most often are OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and SAML 2.0.
      OAuth is a framework for providing authorization to protected resources.
      OpenID Connect is an identity layer that works on top of OAuth and handles
      the authentication of the user. Authorization indicates that the user should
      have access to a resource, but it does not serve to connect the user to an
      existing account.  Authentication, on the other hand, is the process of
      establishing that the entity requesting access can be connected with an
      existing account; it does not indicate whether the user should have access
      to anything.</p>

    <p>SAML is similar to OpenID Connect in that it also handles the
      authentication of the user. SAML, however, is an XML-based framework and
      uses XML in its communications.</p>
    <img alt="Authentication (User Identity Management and Credential Management) and Authorization (Access Control Access Authorization) boxes" src="images/fedidcg-image5.png" width="400"
     height="200">
    <p>Currently, it’s possible for the Relying Party and Identity Provider to
      collect information about the user that the user might not be aware of. It’s
      also possible for different organizations to collude with one another to
      join the data they’ve collected about a user (especially when the
      credentials used include a global identifier such as a user’s email
      address). As a result, user-agents are trying to take a more active role in
      assuring their users’ privacy online, but there are still questions as to
      what role a user-agent should play in federated identity flows.</p>
    <p>There are four possible scenarios for the user-agent’s role: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The status quo is kept, and the user-agent facilitates but doesn’t
          take an active role.</li>
        <li>The user-agent does its best to highlight any potential privacy
          risks for a user but doesn’t try to mitigate the risks directly.
          Instead, the user-agent would ask the user to grant their permission
          to continue. This is referred to as the permission-oriented approach.</li>
        <li>The user-agent takes a more active role by taking on some of the
          current Identity Provider responsibilities. In this case, the
          user-agent manages the user interface and account options shown to
          the user. This is called the mediation-oriented approach.</li>
        <li>The final scenario is one where the user-agent takes on the most
          active role. In it, the user-agent would not only manage the user
          interface presented to a user but would also manage the presentation
          of the required tokens to the Relying Parties. The Identity Providers
          would still be responsible for issuing tokens but would be delegating
          the submission of them to the user-agents. This is why it’s referred
          to as the delegation-oriented approach.</li>
        </ol>
      <p>Each option has compelling pros and cons that trigger debate.  With the
        first option, if the user-agents don’t limit how third-party cookies can
        be used, they will be accountable for the resulting privacy issues and
        concerns - making this an unlikely course of action.  If the user-agents
        continue with the planned privacy changes for third-party cookies, but do
        nothing else, then the areas of identity federation that rely on
        third-party cookies currently will stop working.  This is also untenable,
        so the first option seems unlikely.</p>

      <p>With the second option of the user-agents highlighting the privacy
        risks for their users, it does give users control over their privacy
        choices.  However, historically privacy prompts like this have proven to
        be ineffective at best and a negative user experience at worst.  It places
        all of the responsibility with the users to understand the consequences of
        their choices.  Some users might welcome that, but others certainly
        wouldn’t.</p>

      <p>The third mediation option removes some of this burden from users, but
        in turn it also complicates how the protocols would actually need to work.
        It requires a significant amount of work on the standards that define
        identity federation, and in turn, it will require a yet-to-be-determined
        level of implementation work.  It’s not a trivial change.</p>

      <p>Finally, the fourth option, with the user-agent taking the most active
        role, does protect users from having either the Relying Parties or
        Identity Providers tracking them.  However, it would also be the most
        complicated change and would take the greatest amount of work from not
        only the user-agents, but also the Relying Parties and Identity Providers
        themselves. Specifically, the delegation-oriented model is not likely to
        be backwards compatible with the current deployment, so it’s not a good
        option as a preliminary solution (at least, as a mutually exclusive
        option). The greater the amount of work involved, the longer it typically
        takes to execute a change - and the deprecation of third-party cookies is
        a deadline for this since third-party cookies are often currently
        needed.</p>

      <p>The other concern with the fourth option is that, while the tracking
        risk from Relying Parties or Identity Providers is decreased, it doesn’t
        stop the user-agent itself from engaging in user tracking (although trying
        to restrict this would be something of an unrealistic requirement).
        However, it does limit the number of potential bad actors, but it doesn’t
        necessarily eradicate the tracking risk altogether because if the
        user-agent itself is a bad actor, the user’s privacy would still be at
        risk.</p>

    <h1>Use Cases</h1>
    <h2>Relying Party with Embedded Resources</h2>
    <p>This is one of the most complex of the documented use cases and also the
      most common. A site has embedded components, typically as iframes, which
      require authentication and are often transparent to the user. A seamless
      experience is desired and the user should not have to sign in to each
      component individually.</p>
          <img alt="myapp.com with embedded api.chat.example.com and content.demo.com; embed.cdn.net is embedded in content.demo.com" src="images/fedidcg-image1.jpg">

      </ul>

    <h2>Background Token Renewal</h2>
    <p>Many single-page applications (SPAs) need to acquire or refresh tokens
      silently without interacting with the user. These token requests typically u
      se an embedded hidden iframe to avoid having to reload the page.</p>

      </ul>

    <h2>User Session Management</h2>
      <p>Relying parties may periodically query the identity provider to check
        the status of the user’s session. This is typically done via a
        credentialed request in a hidden iframe. If the session is still valid,
        the RP will likely take no action. If the session is no longer valid,
        the RP will clear the local session and initiate a sign in.</p>

        </ul>

      <h2>Sign Out</h2>
      <p>One of the most widely deployed federated sign out methods is called
        Front Channel Logout, where all sign-out signals occur via the browser
        through a series of redirects and hidden iframes. </p>

       <p>A user starts the process by clicking a logout button from their
         current resource/site/application. The site clears its local session
         and then redirects to the Identity Provider. The IdP clears its local
         session and then loads a series of hidden iframes for all RPs where the
         user currently has an active session. Each of these RPs process the
         request and clear their local session.</p>

    <h1>FedID CG Work Items</h1>

    <p>As of March 2022, the community group has one work item, the <a  href="https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM/">Federated
      Credential Management API</a> (FedCM). FedCM is a Google proposal for a web
      platform API that allows users to login to websites with their federated
      accounts in a privacy-preserving manner.  Google describes it this way:</p>

       <blockquote cite="https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM/">“Federated Credentials Management API aims to fill the
         specific hole left by the removal of third-party cookies on
         federated login. Historically this has relied on third-party cookies
         or navigational redirects in order to function as they were the
         primitives provided by the web.”</blockquote>

      <p>At its heart, this API acts as an active intermediary of identity
        flows. Of the four options we previously outlined , it is a mediation-
        oriented approach. Google did consider other approaches as well, but
        they chose this option because they believe it gives users the greatest
        privacy protections while also still being practical to implement in the
        timeframe before third-party cookies are deprecated.  The FedCM API
        introduces a new consent query that will require the user to acknowledge
        they want a sign-in, sign-up, or sign-out action to happen between the
        RP and the IdP.</p>

      <p>It’s important to realize that FedCM is not intended to be a
        one-size-fits-all answer for all federated identity use cases. It is
        intended to work as a fallback when other potential solutions, such as
        <a href="https://github.com/WICG/first-party-sets">First Party Sets</a>,
        do not apply. It is a stand-alone solution which may
        be used on its own, (although that might result in a less desirable
        user experience). It also works with, rather than in opposition to,
        other possible solutions like enterprise policies and user settings.
        Each potential solution offers different deployment  and user experience
        trade-offs that should be considered as well.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h1>Relationship with Other Initiatives</h1>
      <p>Intersection with other efforts/initiatives (e.g., storage access API)</p>

      <p>There are several low-level primitives that may impact federated
        identity flows, including third-party cookies, first-party cookies,
        LocalStorage, iFrames, redirects, link decoration, form posts, and
        possibly popups.</p>

      <p>The community group has developed a table that takes a high-level view
        of the various authentication protocol primitives and whether or not
        they are likely to be impacted by the deprecation of third-party cookies
        as well as any changes in how browsers handle link decoration or
        redirection. This table is a work-in-progress and is available in our
        GitHub repository [PrimitiveUseCases].  A snapshot of the table is below:</p>

      <p>While there are elements of the identity protocols themselves (e.g.,
      OAuth2, OIDC, SAML) that may be used to work around the deprecation of
      some of those primitives (e.g., using a backchannel logout model in place
      of a front-channel logout model), there are also work items in other
      groups that are important to be aware of.</p>

      <p>The Privacy Community Group has several proposals under development,
      including First Party Sets, Storage Access, Storage Partitioning, and
      several others.[PrivacyCG]  Those proposals are not specifically targeted
      to handle identity federation, but still may be potential solutions for
      different scenarios.</p>

      <p>Google has several proposals, some actively under discussion in a
      community group, others being developed internally, that are being built
      under their Privacy Sandbox efforts.[PrivacySandbox] Similarly, Mozilla’s
      Firefox is focused on several privacy-related products, though none are
      currently targeting the identity federation use cases. Apple’s WebKit has
      focused on their Intelligent Tracking Protection efforts.[ITP]</p>

      <p>The table below lists all of the proposals that might be useful for
      different identity federation use cases.  The proposal names are linked to
      the Github repository where the proposal is being developed.  There you
      can find more information about the proposal, ask any questions you might
      have, and provide any potential feedback.</p>

  <tr>
    <td>CNAMES</td>
    <td colspan="2">You can use DNS CNAME records to turn third-party resources into first-party resources instead.  This is likely only a viable solution if you have only one Relying Party, and own the identity federation flow.  If you do, you can keep your current implementation by creating a custom domain that turns your IdP into the same domain as your app. This requires DNS/domain administration.<br>Not clear if viable long term (<a href="https://github.com/privacycg/meetings/issues/17">context</a>).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Backchannel Logout</td>
    <td colspan="2">Instead of sending logout signals through the user-agent (aka the front  channel), you can switch to communicating server-to-server instead (the back channel).  This removes any reliance on third-party cookies, but it does require new infrastructure for both Identity Providers and relying parties, including potential network changes.  Therefore it’s not viable for many on-premises deployments that are exposed to the internet. <br> </td>

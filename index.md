# Federated Identity Community Group

Hi there!ðŸ‘‹

Weâ€™re the Federated Identity Community Group of the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/).

The Federated Identity [CG](https://www.w3.org/community/) is [chartered](charter) to provide a forum focused on incubating web features that will both support federated identity and prevent untransparent, uncontrollable tracking of users across the web. If that sounds interesting to you, please join us!

## Participate

It's easy to [join](https://www.w3.org/community/fed-id/) the CG if you'd like to contribute to our work. Please note that, in order to join, you'll need to [request a W3C account](https://www.w3.org/accounts/request) if you don't already have one.

We publish a list of [current participants](https://www.w3.org/community/fed-id/participants) on our W3C page.

## Our Work

We conduct all of our technical work in public, mainly in [various GitHub repositories](https://github.com/fedidcg/) but also in periodic teleconferences and face-to-face meetings.

We try to keep the [list of our current work items](charter#work-items) in our [charter](charter) up-to-date. You can follow links from there to each work itemâ€™s GitHub repository, where you can see the latest text, and file or comment on issues.

We discuss new proposals in our [proposals repository](https://github.com/fedidcg/proposals).

We have teleconferences twice a month, and occasional face-to-face meetings throughout the year. 

We organize our meetings and publish the agendas and minutes from them in our [meetings repository](https://github.com/fedidcg/meetings/).
